After the task is closed: The next repeating task will be due the specified number of days after the current task is closed. (Task closed): This task, now closed, was opened as part of a repeating series. When tasks in a series are set to repeat after their due date, Salesforce doesn’t create recurrences that would have been due in the past. Instead, Salesforce keeps adding the interval until a repeated task has a due date in the future. For example, suppose that someone sets a task to repeat three days after it’s due. But, that person doesn’t complete the task (mark it Closed) until five days after it’s due. Instead of creating a task that’s already overdue, Salesforce gives the new task a due date of tomorrow. This due date is equivalent to 6 days after the due date; two intervals of three days each. If that person completes the repeating task (marks it Closed) before the due date, the next task is still due three days after the due date.

Both attempts are part of a single verification and, therefore, have the same ID. The label is Verification Attempt.
    int EventGroup?;

This value is available in API version 37.0 and later. Totp—An authenticator app generated a time-based, one-time password (TOTP) on the user’s mobile device. U2F—A U2F security key-generated required credentials for the user. This value is available in API version 38.0 and later.

TempCode—The user attempted to generate a temporary verification code.
    string Activity?;
    # The status of the identity verification attempt. Available values are: AutomatedSuccess—Salesforce Authenticator approved the request for access because the request came from a trusted location. After users enable location services in Salesforce Authenticator, they can designate trusted locations. When a user trusts a location for a particular activity, such as logging in from a recognized device, that activity is approved from the trusted location for as long as the location is trusted. Denied—The user denied the approval request in the authenticator app, such as Salesforce Authenticator. FailedGeneralError—An error caused by something other than an invalid verification code, too many verification attempts, or authenticator app connectivity. FailedInvalidCode—The user entered an invalid verification code. FailedInvalidPassword—The user entered an invalid password. FailedPasswordLockout—The user attempted to enter a password too many times. FailedTooManyAttempts—The user attempted to verify identity too many times. For example, the user entered an invalid verification code repeatedly. Initiated—Salesforce initiated identity verification but hasn’t yet challenged the user. InProgress—Salesforce challenged the user to verify identity and is waiting for the user to respond or for Salesforce Authenticator to send an automated response. RecoverableError—Salesforce can’t reach the authenticator app to verify identity, but it continues to retry. ReportedDenied—The user denied the approval request in the authenticator app, such as Salesforce Authenticator, and also flagged the approval request to report to an administrator.

    string SourceIp?;
    # The 18-character ID for the record of the geographic location of the user for a successful or unsuccessful identity verification attempt. Due to the nature of geolocation technology, the accuracy of geolocation fields (for example, country, city, postal code) can vary.
    string LoginGeoId?;
    # The text the user sees on the page or in Salesforce Authenticator when prompted to verify identity. For example, if identity verification is required for a user’s login, the user sees “You’re trying to Log In to Salesforce.” In this case, the Remarks value is “Log In to Salesforce.” But if the Activity value is Apex, the Remarks value is a custom description passed by an Apex method. If the user is verifying identity using Salesforce Authenticator, the custom description also appears in the app. If the custom description isn’t specified, the value is the name of the Apex method. The label is Activity Message.
    string Remarks?;
    # If the Activity value is ConnectedApp, the ResourceId value is the ID of the connected app. The label is Connected App ID.
    string ResourceId?;

This verification is triggered when the user tries to access a resource, such as a connected app, report, or dashboard, that requires a high-assurance session level. LightningLogin—Identity verification required for internal users logging in via Lightning Login. This verification is triggered when the enrolled user attempts to log in. Users are eligible to log in if they have the Lightning Login User user permission and have successfully enrolled in Lightning Login. Also, from Session Settings in Setup, Allow Lightning Login must be enabled. PageAccess—Identity verification required for users attempting to perform an action, such as changing an email address or adding a verification method for multi-factor authentication (MFA). PasswordlessLogin—Identity verification required for customers attempting to log in to an Experience Cloud site that is set up for passwordless login. The admin controls which registered verification methods can be used, for example, email, SMS, Salesforce Authenticator, or TOTP. ProfilePolicy—Session security level required at login. This verification is triggered by the Session security level required at login setting on the user’s profile. TwoFactorAuthentication—Multi-factor authentication (formerly called two-factor authentication) required at login.

Or the user permission is included in a permission set that is assigned to a user.

If the IsKnownLinkvalue is true, Salesforce doesn’t copy the LinkState and SalesforceUserId values from the UserProvAccountStaging object to the UserProvAccount object (all other values are copied).

A trigger reaches this state when it exceeds the number of maximum retries with the EventBus.RetryableException. Trigger assertion failures and unhandled exceptions don’t cause the error state. We recommend limiting the retries to fewer than nine times to avoid reaching this state. When you fix and save the trigger, or for a managed package trigger, if you redeploy the package, the trigger resumes automatically from the tip, starting from new events. Also, you can resume a trigger subscription in the subscription detail page that you access from the platform event page. Suspended—The subscriber is disconnected and can’t receive events because a Salesforce admin suspended it or due to an internal error. You can resume a trigger subscription in the subscription detail page that you access from the platform event page. To resume a process, deactivate it and then reactivate it. If you modify the subscriber, the subscription resumes automatically from the tip, starting from new events.

SharedUsers—The file is available to all users who can see the feed to which the file is posted. SharedUsers is used only for files shared with users, and is available only when an org has private org-wide sharing on by default. The SharedUsers value is available in API version 32.0 and later. Note the following exceptions for Visibility. AllUsers & InternalUsers values apply to files posted on standard and custom object records, but not to users, groups, or content libraries. For posts to a record feed, Visibility is set to InternalUsers for all internal users by default. External users can set Visibility only to AllUsers. On user and group posts, only internal users can set Visibility to InternalUsers. For posts to a user feed, if the organization-wide default for user sharing is set to private, Visibility is set to SharedUsers. Only internal users can update Visibility. Visibility can be updated on links to files posted on standard and custom object records, but not to users, groups, or content libraries. Visibility is updatable in API version 43.0 and later.
